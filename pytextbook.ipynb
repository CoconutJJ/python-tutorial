    "This Jupyter Notebook Tutorial is meant for complete beginners in programming. It serves as a extremely short introduction to the parts of computer science relevant to computer programming and also a thorough guide to Python as a beginner. This document was designed to provide the absolute basics of Python, omission or failure to understand parts of this document will severely interfere with your ability to use the Python language in general. Python is a vast language with over hundreds of features and libraries, taking the time to understand every single library is not only a waste of time but also a nearly impossible feat. The goal of this tutorial is cover the utmost basics of Python and create an arsenal of skills that are required to learn about Python libraries and other programming languages.\n",

    "- Be sure that you are actually typing and running the code, and not copying and pasting through (i.e Ctrl-C). This makes sure you are actually paying attention to the syntax, which is perhaps one the major obstacles as a beginner \n",
    "    - If you run into an error, double check you have copied the code correctly\n",
    "    - Try and read the error that the computer tells you. It may be a little scary at first, but understand what you can!\n",
    "    - Copy and paste the error message into Google, site like StackOverflow may be helpful\n",
    "- **Programming is not a spectator sport!** While typing out the code yourself may seem tedious, if you cannot even copy my code correctly, how do expect to be able to write your own Python program?\n",
    "    - Therefore, make the commitment to practice a few hours (2-3 hours) everyday\n",
    "    - Programming requires consistent concentration and a steady train of thought, getting distracted every 30 minutes or so because you need to get grocercies, take a break or walk the dog is going to severely impact your quality of learning! -->"

    "\n",
    "In the `__init__` method, we can also specify class properties, simply by prefixing the property name with `self.`. The dot notation is used a lot in Python and many other languages, in this case and in many other cases it is used to symbolize belonging. So when we write `self.w` we are saying `w` belongs to `self`. Remembering that `self` is just a reference to the object itself, it says `w` belongs to every instance of `Rectangle` or that `w` is property of `Rectangle` (when we say an instance of a `class` we are talking about an aribtrary `object` from that `class`.). Similar to how variables work, when a property such as `self.w` is on the left hand side of the `=` symbol, it is interpreted as a definition/initialization of `w` and in all other cases it is interpreted as the value `self.w` contains. \n",

While these terms are used loosely and sometimes interchangably which consequently assumes the specific concept will be understood, it has been carefully used in it's most accurate definition for this document as to draw a distinction between two different concepts.
